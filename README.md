I am a social scientist in the field of management and organization studies at emlyon business school, France.

At the intersection of organization theory and cultural sociology, my research dives into the influence of culture and meaning structures on organizations and their audiences across different levels. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, I apply a cultural perspective to investigate phenomena like institutional persistence and social evaluation. My work spans various empirical contexts, from social housing to the vibrant landscapes of the creative industry, including areas such as restaurants, books, and movies.
